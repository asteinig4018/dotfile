# dotfile

Just a collection of ssh and vim settings 
including plugins.
Also includes tmux config as well, but requires an updated to the local powerline directory. 

## Use
```./setup.sh``` from your home directory to move the files around and create the symbolic links in the correct spot.

```./move_ssh.sh``` to relocate ssh config files and keys and the like.
